## Swift version
The latest version of Kitura-CredentialsGitHub works with the DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-08-23-a version of the Swift binaries. You can download this version of the Swift binaries by following this [link](https://swift.org/download/). Compatibility with other Swift versions is not guaranteed.

## Example of GitHub web login
First create an instance of `CredentialsGitHub` plugin and register it with `Credentials` framework:
```swift
import Credentials
import CredentialsGitHub

let credentials = Credentials()
let gitCredentials = CredentialsGitHub(clientId: gitClientId, clientSecret: gitClientSecret, callbackUrl: serverUrl + "/login/github/callback", userAgent: "my-kitura-app")
credentials.register(gitCredentials)
```
**Where:**
- *gitClientId* is the Client ID of your app in your GitHub Developer applications
- *gitClientSecret* is the Client Secret of your app in your GitHub Developer applications
- *userAgent* is an optional argument that passes along a User-Agent of your choice on API calls against GitHub. By default, `Kitura-CredentialsGitHub` is set as the User-Agent. [User-Agent is required when invoking GitHub APIs](https://developer.github.com/v3/#user-agent-required).

**Note:** The *callbackUrl* parameter above is used to tell the GitHub web login page where the user's browser should be redirected when the login is successful. It should be a URL handled by the server you are writing.
Specify where to redirect non-authenticated requests:
```swift
credentials.options["failureRedirect"] = "/login/github"
```

Connect `credentials` middleware to requests to `/private`:

```swift
router.all("/private", middleware: credentials)
router.get("/private/data", handler: { request, response, next in
  ...  
  next()
})
```
And call `authenticate` to login with GitHub and to handle the redirect (callback) from the GitHub login web page after a successful login:

```swift
router.get("/login/github",
handler: credentials.authenticate(gitCredentials.name))

router.get("/login/github/callback",
handler: credentials.authenticate(gitCredentials.name))
```
